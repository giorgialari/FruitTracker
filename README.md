# FruitTracker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.3.

This site returns the main nutritional information on each fruit. The site relies on the https://fruityvice.com/ API.

Bootstrap and Bootswatch were used for the creation of the graphics in the construction of this site.

```diff
- This API has a CORS issue. To start the app you need to use the command:

- `npm start` or `ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json`, so as to rely on the proxy.conf.js which is inside the code. The site doesn't work from /dist.
```
## Development server

Run `npm start` or `ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
